                <article><h6>You found me.</h6><p class="text-justify">Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio — I have worn many hats in my professional life and having a place to display my many projects and interests has been a joy to work on.
                  <br><br>
                  My name is Kat R. Buchanan, I am a 26-year-old creative living between Kansas City, MO and Nashville, TN (until summer 2021, when I plan on moving to Kansas City fulltime). As a youth, I was solely focused on journalism and rose in rank to become the co-editor of my high school newspaper my senior year, winning a few national awards along the way. I attended journalism school for a year at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and was very involved in their photojournalism program — my first semester I even received a grant to go on a documentary photography trip to Sao Paulo, Brazil.
                  <br><br>
                  After a year of school and working multiple jobs in journalism (staff photographer, multimedia intern for a music journalism site Hear Nebraska), I wanted to try something new. I entered fields like wine cellar work, restaurant serving, event catering — things that taught me many new interpersonal and organizational skills that I use every day.
                  <br><br>
                  I began to miss my roots of spending hours on the computer, so in late 2014 I founded a web design company with the help of a manager at my deli job. He was Google Analytics certified and I had a strong background in layout and graphic design (and, mainly, an Adobe subscription). I used my tentative knowledge of Drupal, WordPress and Adobe Muse to make websites for clients, mostly hiring out for backend work.
                  <br><br>
                  Over time our projects became scarce and eventually fizzled out as we both changed jobs and moved cities. I have since let my design skills become outdated, so I recently enrolled in KU's Coding Bootcamp to reimmerse myself in the world wide web and its design and functions.
                  This portolio currently showcases recent photography work, but will soon be filled with deployed web applications and beautiful UX/UI projects!
